# bcc
A compiler for the B programming language. Programmed in C, we're developing BCC to be a modern compiler for an extinct language. B allows us to look into the past; to see the history of computing that has brought us to where modern machines are.

BCC aims to create a realistic compilter for B, capturing its ideas and goals in a modern software. B intends on being a language designed for system programming and non-numeric programming.
